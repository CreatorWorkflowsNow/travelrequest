# Introduction
## Goal

In this session, you will get hands-on experience in creating a Travel Request application using the ServiceNow platform. We will cover concepts such as Building Tables, Record Producers, Integrations and Workflows within App Engine Studio - our low-code application development interface for developers of any level of experience.

## Background

![relative](images/nowairline.png)

As the Travel and Expense manager at ACME Corporation , you currently have very little visibility and control in the travel plans of your employees. Any travel plans now are requested via email from an employee to their manager, and you only get notified once the expense claims come in. The CFO has hence given you the task of better managing the costs associated with travel of your employees, and making sure that their travels are justifiable and reasonable. With that in mind, you have decided to take things in your own hands and build a Travel Request application leveraging the ServiceNow platform.
