# Bonus Exercise: Integrating via APIs

In this bonus exercise, we will use a real webservice API to update our list of airports which we previously imported via an excel spreadsheet. This will ensure that the locations all remain up to date, and users can select from any airport required.

*Note: This session will require you to use a 3rd party API service to get data. Your personal data will be required to sign up to this service. If you are not comfortable with exposing this data, skip this exercise or let your instructor know.*

1. Go to https://airlabs.co/ and click **Sign Up**
